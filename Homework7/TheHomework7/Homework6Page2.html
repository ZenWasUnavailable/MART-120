        <h2> 
            A man was wandering through the woods and came across the oldest and wisest trees of the forest.
            He asked the old trees if they would lend him a branch so that he can fassion a tool. The old trees, not wanting 
            to part with even one of their many limbs, offered the man a very young and very small sapling instead. The man took
            the sapling and used it to forge his axe. Then, he returned to the woods and chopped down all the oldest trees.
